## Summary of API Functionality and FAQs

This API allows people and institutions to create [items](./appendices/terminology.md#item) in Internet Archive, to upload files to those items, and to maintain the [metadata](./metadata.md) for the items.

[Internet Archive](http://archive.org)–best known as the home of the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)–is also home to over 10 [petabytes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte) of data.

* [Live Music Archive](https://archive.org/details/etree), where you can find over 10,000 recordings of live performances by a plethora of bands
* [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/), where you can borrow and view millions of free ebooks
* [Prelinger Archives](https://archive.org/details/prelinger), a priceless collection of over 60,000 ephemeral films
